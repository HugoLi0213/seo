# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

To host this web application, deploy to Vercel:

1.  Import your project into Vercel from your Git repository.
2.  Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js application and configure the deployment.
3.  Push changes to your Git repository to trigger new deployments.
